# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data. This notebook demonstrates the full pipeline: data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new/unseen data.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent (class = 1) or legitimate (class = 0).
- **Dataset**: Credit card transaction data (features + target label).
- **Approach**:
  - Load and explore data
  - Clean / preprocess (including scaling / normalization)
  - Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest / Logistic Regression / Other)
  - Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
  - Provide ability to predict new transactions

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Key libraries:
  - `pandas` â€” for data loading/manipulation
  - `numpy` â€” numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` â€” preprocessing, model building, evaluation
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` â€” visualization of results
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for documenting & running experiments
